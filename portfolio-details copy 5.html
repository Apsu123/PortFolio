                  <p class="mt-2 text-center text-muted">Move validation logic.
This is a central part of the game logic because it checks whether a move is legal. The check is performed by examining the states of the “buttons,” or cells, in the grid. The player and the opponent have states of 0 or 1 depending on their color. Empty cells have a state of –1.

For a move to be legal, the target cell must be empty, and the cells starting from the adjacent one must all belong to the opponent, followed by a final cell that belongs to the player again. This check is performed separately in all eight directions, using similar code blocks. These blocks are part of a function that returns true and calls the turning function if the move is valid in at least one direction.

The boolean correct is used to determine when it becomes the opponent’s turn. The code shown in the image checks the cells vertically above the player’s proposed move. This results in a lot of code and could be simplified by reusing parts of it, but at this stage I just want it to work..</p>

                  <p class="mt-2 text-center text-muted">Turning the buttons.
If the proposed move is legal, this function is called. It takes the player’s color, the move’s coordinates, the coordinate at which to stop turning buttons, and the current board state. It then flips all the buttons between the starting coordinates and the limit j.

Again, this is done in all directions where pieces can be flipped. For example, the function shown turns all the buttons to the right of the move. In addition to updating the visible color, each button’s state property must be updated.

I had some difficulties passing the updated board state around and ensuring it stayed consistent in other parts of the program. This required a lot of pointer and reference handling—confusing and sometimes even frustrating.</p>

                  <p class="mt-2 text-center text-muted">Header file.
This header file contains all the functions used by the game. Unfortunately, they aren’t listed in the order they are executed, but the flow goes something like this:

When a game is started or restarted, the main Othello object is created. This recreates the initial game state. When the player clicks a button on the board, buttonClick is called to check all directions and determine whether the move is valid. If it is, the appropriate turning function is triggered; if not, nothing happens and the player must click elsewhere.

After a correct move, isMovesLeft checks whether the board contains any valid moves. If it does, correctAiMove follows. It isn’t actually an AI—it simply picks a random move. I just wanted it to be an AI. The function selects random coordinates x and y, checks whether the move is legal, and flips the buttons if it is.

If no valid moves remain, endGame is called. This function scans the states of all the buttons on the board and determines who has the majority.</p>

This video shows example gameplay, from opening moves to the end of the game. The board UI works very smoothly with no bugs, despite the many checks that must be run after each move. This reliability is thanks to the robustness of Qt and C++.

What I don’t like about this version is the appearance of the other UI elements, such as the restart button. I didn’t put much effort into making them visually appealing, and it shows. There’s also a fun option that lets you switch sides in the middle of the game—this was mainly to save me from the embarrassment of losing to this very dumb opponent.

Creating your own versions of games is fun because you can customize them however you like. The file responsible for the UI is othello.ui, although I didn’t have to write code there directly. The board and UI updates are created dynamically in othello.cpp. Qt offers almost limitless possibilities, allowing you to add nearly any component you can imagine.</p>
